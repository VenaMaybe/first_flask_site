						I'm Vena â€” a student at the City College of San Francisco and currently pursuing a dual major in Computer Engineering and Business. I love to yap about anything and everything that falls under the purview of my interests. Whether it's C++, writing short stories, or the weird things my friends get up to, let me share those stories with you :)
